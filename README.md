# MNIST CNN Classifier

This is a basic CNN that uses Tensorflow to predict the labels for the MNIST dataset. This is based off of [Deep Learning CNN's in Tensorflow with GPUs](https://hackernoon.com/deep-learning-cnns-in-tensorflow-with-gpus-cba6efe0acc2)
and the [Tensorflow Documentation for CNNs](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/cnn).

## Setup

1. Clone the repo
2. Download the dataset and change the datapath accordingly
3. Run train.py

## Dataset

This uses the [MNIST Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv).
